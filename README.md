  These MCP servers act as linkages between LLMs/Agents and real-world humanitarian data APIs.<br/>
  They are compatible with any MCP-capable AI assistant or agent framework.
</p>

This repository contains seven **MCP servers** that connect LLMs/Agents to live humanitarian data — letting any MCP-compatible AI assistant query real-world disaster, displacement, food security, and resettlement data without copy-pasting or manual lookups.

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that serves as a linkage layer between LLMs/Agents and external tools, APIs, and data sources. Instead of manually retrieving data and pasting it into a chat window, you install an MCP server once and any compatible AI assistant or agent can call it automatically — like a plugin system for AI. These servers were ideated for [Claude](https://claude.ai) <img src="https://github.com/anthropics.png?size=20" alt="Claude" height="14" style="vertical-align:middle"/> but follow the open MCP standard and work with any LLM or agent that supports the protocol.

**IFRC** stands for the _International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies_. The **GO** (Global Operations)[IFRC GO](https://go.ifrc.org) platform is a public database tracking humanitarian operations, disaster appeals, field reports, and response activities worldwide.

**Monty** (short for Montandon) [Monty](https://go.ifrc.org/montandon-landing) is a geospatial data API built on the **STAC** standard (_SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog_) — a common format for cataloguing earth observation and disaster-related datasets.

**HDX HAPI** is the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org) API run by OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs). It provides structured, cross-country access to humanitarian indicators: displacement figures, food security phases, conflict events, funding coverage, population statistics, and more.

**UNHCR** is the _UN Refugee Agency_. Their **Population Statistics API** exposes the global refugee database — figures on refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, stateless persons, and durable solutions going back decades. Their **Resettlement (RSQ) API** covers submissions and departures for formal resettlement programmes worldwide. Both APIs are fully public and require no authentication.

**IPC-CH** is the [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification](https://ipcinfo.org) — the global standard for classifying acute and chronic food insecurity. Their Public API provides official analyses, sub-national area phase data, population estimates, and IDP point data across crisis-affected countries.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** v18 or later — download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** — comes bundled with Node.js
- **Claude Desktop** <img src="https://github.com/anthropics.png?size=20" alt="Claude" height="14" style="vertical-align:middle"/> — the Mac/Windows app from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), or any other MCP-compatible LLM/Agent host
- **An IFRC GO API token** — create a free account at [go.ifrc.org](https://go.ifrc.org) and generate a token from your profile settings
- **An HDX app identifier** — register your app at [hapi.humdata.org](https://hapi.humdata.org/docs#/Util/get_encoded_identifier_api_v1_encode_identifier_get) to get a free base64-encoded identifier
- **A FEWS NET FDW account** — register at [fdw.fews.net](https://fdw.fews.net) to obtain a username and password
- **An IPC API key** — register at [ipcinfo.org](https://ipcinfo.org) to obtain a free API key

> **Note:** The two UNHCR servers require no API token — they use a fully public API.

---

## One-time Setup

### 1. Clone or download this repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> MCPs
cd MCPs
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file

Create a file named `.env` in the root `MCPs/` folder (all servers will find it automatically):

```bash
# Required by IFRC GO and Monty servers
IFRC_API_TOKEN=your_ifrc_token_here

# Optional — only needed for Monty if you want a non-default URL
MONTY_API_URL=https://montandon-eoapi-stage.ifrc.org/stac

# Required by HDX HAPI server
HDX_API_TOKEN=your_base64_encoded_hdx_identifier_here

# Required by FEWS NET FDW server
FEWSNET_USERNAME=your_fewsnet_username_here
FEWSNET_PASSWORD=your_fewsnet_password_here

# Required by IPC-CH server
IPC_API_KEY=your_ipc_api_key_here
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens. The UNHCR servers need no entries in this file.

> **Tip:** You can also place the `.env` file inside an individual server folder (e.g., `hdx-mcp/`). Each server searches in multiple locations.

### 3. Install dependencies for each server

```bash
cd ifrc-mcp && npm install && cd ..
cd monty-mcp && npm install && cd ..
cd hdx-mcp && npm install && cd ..
cd unhcr-refugees-mcp && npm install && cd ..
cd unhcr-resettlement-mcp && npm install && cd ..
cd fewsnet-mcp && npm install && cd ..
cd ipc-mcp && npm install && cd ..
```

## Configure Your LLM/Agent Host

These servers work with any MCP-compatible LLM or agent framework. The example below shows configuration for **Claude Desktop** <img src="https://github.com/anthropics.png?size=20" alt="Claude" height="14" style="vertical-align:middle"/>, which was the primary host these servers were developed and tested against.

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Open it (create it if it doesn't exist) and add the following entries under `mcpServers`. Replace `/YOUR/PATH/TO` with the actual path to this repository:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ifrc-go": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/ifrc-mcp/server.js"]
    },
    "monty": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/monty-mcp/index.js"]
    },
    "hdx-hapi": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/hdx-mcp/server.js"]
    },
    "unhcr-refugees": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/unhcr-refugees-mcp/server.js"]
    },
    "unhcr-resettlement": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/unhcr-resettlement-mcp/server.js"]
    },
    "fewsnet": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/fewsnet-mcp/server.js"]
    },
    "ipc-ch": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/ipc-mcp/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, **restart Claude Desktop** (or your MCP-compatible agent host). You should see all seven servers' tools available in the tools panel.

> **Other MCP hosts:** If you are connecting these servers to a different LLM or agent framework (e.g. a custom agent built with the MCP SDK, or another Claude-compatible tool), consult that framework's documentation for how to register stdio-transport MCP servers.

## IFRC GO MCP Server

### About

This server links LLMs/Agents to the [IFRC GO API](https://goadmin.ifrc.org) — a comprehensive database of humanitarian operations run by the Red Cross and Red Crescent network. You can ask an AI assistant questions like:

- _"What emergency appeals are active in Sudan right now?"_
- _"Show me the disaster history for Kenya in 2023."_
- _"List all surge personnel currently deployed to Turkey."_
- _"What DREFs are active in the Asia Pacific region?"_

This server links LLMs/Agents to the **Montandon STAC API** — a geospatial catalog of disaster event datasets built on the [STAC specification](https://stacspec.org). It lets you browse and search collections of earth observation and disaster data.

**STAC** (_SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog_) is an open standard for cataloguing geospatial data. Think of a _collection_ as a dataset category, and an _item_ as a single event or record within that category, with attached files (images, shapefiles, etc.) called _assets_.

Example questions you can ask an AI assistant:

- _"List all available Monty data collections."_
- _"Search for flood events in East Africa in 2024."_
- _"What items are in the DesInventar collection?"_

## HDX HAPI MCP Server

### About

This server links LLMs/Agents to the **OCHA Humanitarian Data Exchange API** ([HDX HAPI](https://hapi.humdata.org)) — a structured, cross-country dataset covering the key indicators humanitarian responders rely on. Data is sourced from UNHCR, WFP, ACLED, IPC, and other authoritative providers.

Example questions you can ask an AI assistant:

- _"How many IDPs are there in South Sudan, broken down by province?"_
- _"What is the food security situation in Somalia right now?"_
- _"Show me conflict events in Sudan in 2024."_
- _"Which organisations are operating in the health sector in Afghanistan?"_
- _"What is the humanitarian funding coverage for Yemen's HRP?"_
- _"Get rainfall anomaly data for the Sahel for the last 3 months."_

### Getting an HDX App Identifier

The HDX HAPI requires a free **app identifier** (a base64-encoded string) instead of a traditional API key:

1. Go to the [HDX HAPI identifier encoder](https://hapi.humdata.org/docs#/Util/get_encoded_identifier_api_v1_encode_identifier_get)
2. Enter your name, organisation, and email address
3. Copy the resulting base64 string
4. Add it to your `.env` file as `HDX_API_TOKEN=<your_string>`

### Available Tools

The tools are grouped by data category.

## UNHCR Resettlement Data MCP Server

### About

This server links LLMs/Agents to the [UNHCR Resettlement Statistics (RSQ) API](https://api.unhcr.org/rsq/v1) — a dedicated dataset tracking formal resettlement programmes: UNHCR submissions to resettlement countries and actual departures. The API is fully public and requires no authentication.

**Resettlement** is one of UNHCR's three durable solutions. It involves transferring refugees from a country of asylum to a third country that has agreed to admit them. The RSQ API tracks both _submissions_ (UNHCR referrals to a resettlement state) and _departures_ (persons who have actually left for the resettlement country).

Example questions you can ask an AI assistant:

- _"How many refugees were submitted for resettlement to Canada in 2023?"_
- _"Show me resettlement departure trends from Kenya to the US over the last decade."_
- _"What is the age and gender breakdown of resettlement submissions from Afghanistan?"_
- _"Which countries received the most resettlement departures in 2022?"_

## FEWS NET MCP Server

### About

This server links LLMs/Agents to the [FEWS NET Famine Early Warning Systems Network API](https://fdw.fews.net) — a comprehensive database of food security conditions, market prices, crop production, nutrition, and humanitarian response data across crisis-affected countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

**FEWS NET** is a USAID-funded early warning system that monitors acute food insecurity. Its core output is the **IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification)** — a standardised scale (Phase 1=Minimal to Phase 5=Famine/Catastrophe) used by governments, UN agencies, and NGOs to trigger and scale humanitarian response.

**Registration required:** Create a free account at [fdw.fews.net](https://fdw.fews.net), then add your username and password to the `.env` file.

Example questions you can ask an AI assistant:

- _"What is the current IPC food security situation in Ethiopia by region?"_
- _"Show me maize prices in Nairobi markets over the past year."_
- _"How many people are in IPC Phase 3 or above in Somalia?"_
- _"What are the latest crop production estimates for the East Africa region?"_
- _"Show me exchange rate trends for the South Sudanese Pound."_
- _"What humanitarian food assistance is being tracked in Yemen?"_

#### IPC Food Security Classifications

The **IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification)** is the primary output of FEWS NET — it classifies geographic areas on a 5-point scale of acute food insecurity severity. Phase 3+ (Crisis and above) is the threshold for humanitarian action.

**Scenarios:** `CS` = Current Situation (observed), `ML1` = Most Likely Near-Term Projection (~2 months), `ML2` = Most Likely Medium-Term Projection (~4–6 months).

## Troubleshooting

### IFRC GO Server

**`FATAL: Cannot start server. Missing IFRC_API_TOKEN`**
Your `.env` file is missing or doesn't contain `IFRC_API_TOKEN`. Check that the file exists in the root `MCPs/` folder (or inside `ifrc-mcp/`) and contains a line like `IFRC_API_TOKEN=abc123...`.

**`API Error 401`**
Your token is invalid or has expired. Log in to [go.ifrc.org](https://go.ifrc.org) and regenerate your API token.

**`API Error 404`**
The server is configured to use `https://goadmin.ifrc.org`. If you're hitting 404 errors, make sure you have not edited the base URL in `server.js` to point to the old `https://go-api.ifrc.org` host.

**`Failed to install dependencies`** (IFRC server only)
The IFRC server tries to auto-install its dependencies if they're missing. If this fails, run `npm install` manually from the `ifrc-mcp/` folder.

### HDX HAPI Server

**`FATAL: Cannot start. HDX_API_TOKEN not found`**
Your `.env` file is missing or doesn't contain `HDX_API_TOKEN`. Get your free app identifier at [hapi.humdata.org](https://hapi.humdata.org/docs#/Util/get_encoded_identifier_api_v1_encode_identifier_get).

**`API Error 401` or `403`**
Your app identifier is invalid or malformed. Make sure you copied the full base64 string from the HDX identifier encoder without any extra spaces or line breaks.

**`API Error 422`**
A parameter value is invalid — check the allowed values for filters like `ipc_phase`, `population_group`, or `event_type` in the tool descriptions above.

### UNHCR Servers

**`API Error 400`**
A filter parameter is invalid. Check that country codes are valid 3-character UNHCR or ISO3 codes (use `list_countries` to look them up), and that year values are integers within the available range (use `list_years` to check).

**`Empty results`**
The UNHCR Population and RSQ APIs only return data for country-year combinations that exist in the database. Try broadening your filters or removing the `coo`/`coa` constraints to confirm data exists for your query.

### IPC-CH Server

**`ERROR: API Key not found`**
Your `.env` file is missing or doesn't contain `IPC_API_KEY`. Register at [ipcinfo.org](https://ipcinfo.org) to get a free key and add `IPC_API_KEY=your_key` to your `.env` file.

**`API Error 401` or `403`**
Your API key is invalid or has expired. Check that you copied the full key without extra spaces, or re-generate it from your IPC account.

**`get_population_tracking` returns very large data or times out**
Always pass a `country` or `start`/`end` year filter when using this tool. Without filters it returns the entire global population tracking history, which is extremely large.

### All Servers

**Tools don't appear in Claude Desktop or your LLM/Agent host**

- Make sure you saved the config file and fully restarted the application (quit, don't just close the window).
- Check that the file paths in the config exactly match where you cloned this repository.
- On macOS you can verify paths by running `ls /YOUR/PATH/TO/MCPs/ifrc-mcp/server.js` in Terminal.
